# Durability Guarantees

glide-mq is durable to the extent that your Valkey deployment is durable.

The queue stores jobs in native Valkey data structures:

- job hashes for payload, metadata, attempts, progress, and return values
- streams + consumer groups for waiting and active delivery state
- sorted sets for delayed / prioritized jobs, completed jobs, and failed jobs
- one Valkey function library for queue operations

Those structures survive restarts only if Valkey is configured to persist them.

## The Short Version

- `appendonly yes` is the recommended baseline for production queues.
- `appendfsync everysec` is a good default when you want low latency with a small worst-case loss window.
- `appendfsync always` minimizes the persistence window further, but costs throughput and latency.
- RDB-only snapshots are usually not enough for queues unless you can tolerate losing all writes since the last snapshot.
- glide-mq provides **at-least-once** delivery semantics, not exactly-once.
- If a worker crashes after claiming a job but before acking it, the job is not silently lost; another worker can reclaim it from the pending entries list. Priority and LIFO jobs have no pending entry and are found by a bounded keyspace scan instead.

## What Persists

When Valkey persistence is enabled, these glide-mq state transitions are persisted with the rest of the dataset:

- enqueued jobs
- delayed / prioritized jobs waiting in the scheduled sorted set
- completed / failed job state
- stream entries and consumer groups
- pending entries list (PEL) state for jobs that were claimed but not yet acked
- the `glidemq` Valkey function library itself

This matters because glide-mq uses Valkey Streams and consumer groups instead of a BRPOP-style list pop. A claimed-but-unacked job stays recoverable through the PEL until it is acked or reclaimed.

## Persistence Modes

### RDB snapshots

RDB snapshots write point-in-time dumps on a schedule such as `save 60 10000`.

Pros:

- low write overhead
- simple to operate

Trade-offs:

- A crash can lose every write since the last successful snapshot
- Not ideal if you need queue state to survive process or host failure with a small loss window

For queues, RDB-only is usually a recovery/snapshot tool, not the primary durability strategy.

### AOF

AOF appends write operations to a log and is the usual recommendation for queue workloads.

Common `appendfsync` choices:

- `everysec`: better performance, but a crash can lose roughly the last second of acknowledged writes
- `always`: strongest persistence, but highest latency / lowest throughput
- `no`: lowest durability; usually not appropriate for production queues

### Hybrid AOF + RDB preamble

If your Valkey version supports it, keeping AOF enabled with the RDB preamble gives faster restarts while preserving the operational model of AOF.

## Recommended Valkey Config

For most production queue workloads, start here and tune from measurement:

```conf
appendonly yes
appendfsync everysec
# If supported by your Valkey version:
aof-use-rdb-preamble yes
```

Then choose RDB snapshots based on your backup / restore needs, for example:

```conf
save 60 10000
```

If AOF is already enabled, treat RDB snapshots as optional and tune them against your write volume and save overhead. Frequent background saves can add fork / persistence pressure on busy queue workloads.

If your queue cannot tolerate the `everysec` loss window, move to `appendfsync always` and benchmark the throughput cost before rollout.

## Restart Behavior

With persistence enabled:

- waiting jobs remain in the stream
- delayed and prioritized jobs remain in the scheduled sorted set
- completed / failed jobs remain in their sorted sets and hashes
- consumer groups and pending entries survive with the stream data
- the Valkey function library survives in the dataset and is also re-ensured by clients on startup

glide-mq additionally re-ensures the function library when clients connect or reconnect, including after topology changes and cluster failover.

## Worker Crash Behavior

If a worker crashes mid-processing:

1. the job has already been claimed into the consumer group's pending entries list
2. it is **not** removed from Valkey just because the worker died
3. another worker's scheduler reclaims the stalled entry via `XAUTOCLAIM`
4. the reclaim path increments `stalledCount` and:
   - **redispatches** the job back to the queue so a healthy worker can pick it up again, when `stalledCount <= maxStalledCount` (default `1`)
   - **fails** the job (state = `failed`, reason = `job stalled more than maxStalledCount`) once `stalledCount` exceeds the limit, instead of leaving it in limbo

Priority and LIFO jobs are popped from lists and have no pending entry, so `XAUTOCLAIM` cannot see them. `glidemq_reclaimStalledListJobs` finds them through a same-slot `list-active-ids` set that every list claim and release maintains. Until one complete `SCAN` has seeded that set, and whenever the set has fewer members than the `list-active` counter (for example, jobs claimed by workers on an older library), it falls back to a bounded `SCAN` over job hashes (at most 1000 SCAN steps per call, starting from cursor 0), so on a very large keyspace a stalled list job past that bound can stay unrecovered in that fallback. The periodic `glidemq_healListActive` (every 10th promotion tick of each worker) trusts the seeded set while it has at least as many members as the counter: it drops members that are no longer active claims and corrects the counter from what is left, with no `SCAN`. When the seed marker is missing or the set has fewer members than the counter (claims made by an older library), it re-seeds from a `SCAN` that resumes from a cursor kept in `meta` (`listActiveScanCursor`, at most 500 pages per call), so a large keyspace completes over several ticks and the set is trusted again only once the scan has wrapped; a set left inconsistent by a library downgrade and re-upgrade heals this way. Neither reclaim path runs while the queue is paused.

A stream claim a worker holds while waiting for a `globalConcurrency` slot is an un-activated claim like any other: if it sat in the pending list longer than `stalledInterval`, stalled reclaim redispatches it and counts a stall. Workers hand such claims back after at most half the shorter of `lockDuration` and `stalledInterval`, so this only happens to a worker that died while holding one.

Consumers are cleaned up too. A graceful `worker.close()` deletes the worker's consumer from the group once it holds no pending entry (`glidemq_removeIdleConsumer` checks and deletes in one step, because `XGROUP DELCONSUMER` would drop pending entries). Each stalled reclaim also deletes up to 20 other consumers of the group that hold nothing and have been idle longer than `max(10 * stalledInterval, 3 * blockTimeout, 60s)`, so consumers of dead processes do not accumulate. A live idle worker that gets deleted this way is recreated by its next `XREADGROUP`.

This means a single crash gets a retry; chronic crashing produces a clean terminal failure. AI-style workloads that take minutes-to-hours per job benefit from the retry: a transient worker death does not cost the whole run, and processors that store progress via `job.moveToDelayed(timestamp, nextStep)` resume from the most recent checkpoint.

This is an important difference from older queue designs that rely on destructive pops and app-side lock bookkeeping.

## Cluster Failover Behavior

glide-mq works with Valkey cluster replication and re-ensures its function library on reconnect/failover, but durability during failover still depends on the underlying replication and persistence settings.

Important caveat:

- Valkey replication is asynchronous
- A primary failure can still lose recently acknowledged writes that were not yet replicated or fsynced

That means failover improves availability, but it does not by itself create exactly-once or zero-loss guarantees.

## Delivery Semantics

glide-mq is designed for **at-least-once** processing:

- A job may be redelivered after worker crash, connection loss, or stalled reclaim
- processors should therefore be idempotent whenever side effects matter

glide-mq does **not** guarantee:

- exactly-once execution
- atomic coordination with external side effects
- zero-loss behavior independent of Valkey persistence / replication settings

| System                                             | Typical durability model                                                                              | Delivery semantics | Main trade-off                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| glide-mq + Valkey AOF (`everysec`)                 | AOF-backed queue state with a small crash window                                                      | At-least-once      | Lower write cost than `always`, in exchange for a small possible loss window on hard crash |
| glide-mq + Valkey AOF (`always`)                   | Strongest Valkey persistence mode                                                                     | At-least-once      | Smallest persistence window, in exchange for higher write cost                             |
| pg-boss / PostgreSQL                               | Backed by PostgreSQL WAL / transaction durability                                                     | At-least-once      | Strong database durability, in exchange for PostgreSQL operational and latency tradeoffs   |
| RabbitMQ with durable queues + persistent messages | Broker durability when queues/messages are durable and producers use publisher confirms appropriately | At-least-once      | Mature broker durability model, in exchange for more broker-specific configuration surface |

Compared with BullMQ-style Redis queues, glide-mq still depends on the same underlying Valkey durability settings, but its in-flight recovery model is built on Streams consumer groups, the PEL, and `XAUTOCLAIM` rather than a separate lock-renew / stall-detection cycle.

## Feature-Specific Durability

The core persistence guarantees above apply to all queue state. Several features have additional durability characteristics worth noting.

### Schedulers

Scheduler configurations persist in the `glide:{queueName}:schedulers` hash. Each field stores the scheduler name and its next-run timestamp. These entries survive restart with any persistence mode that captures hash writes. When a worker reconnects after a restart, it resumes its promotion loop and picks up any schedulers whose next-run time has already passed.

### Metrics

Time-series metrics data is stored in `glide:{queueName}:metrics:*` keys. Data is retained for 24 hours and auto-trimmed. This data survives restart if AOF is enabled; with RDB-only, recent metrics may be lost depending on snapshot frequency.

### Group State

Token bucket state, rate limit windows, and ordering sequence counters are stored in `glide:{queueName}:group:{key}` hash keys. All fields (active count, maxConcurrency, rateMax, rateDuration, window start, token count, refill rate, etc.) are persisted as part of the hash and survive restart with the rest of the dataset.

### Deduplication

Dedup entries are stored in the `glide:{queueName}:dedup` hash, with field-level TTL semantics managed by the Lua functions. These entries persist with AOF. After a restart, dedup windows that have not expired continue to prevent duplicate job submission.

### Step Jobs

When a processor calls `moveToDelayed`, the job is moved to the scheduled ZSet with a new timestamp score and `data.step` is updated atomically within the same Lua function call. The delayed job survives restart like any other entry in the scheduled ZSet, and the promotion loop re-queues it once the timestamp is reached.

### Broadcast

Stream entries in broadcast queues are intentionally not deleted after processing (no XDEL). Each consumer group independently tracks its own read offset. After a restart, consumer groups resume from their last acknowledged position, so a subscriber sees the messages added while it was down as long as they are still in the stream. `maxMessages` is a hard cap: it trims the oldest entries on publish even when a subscription has not read them, and those messages are lost for that subscription. A message a subscription's worker claimed but did not finish is reclaimed and run again by another worker of the same subscription (see [Broadcast - Crash and stall recovery](./broadcast#crash-and-stall-recovery)).

## Practical Guidance

- If your priority is throughput with strong-enough durability, use AOF with `appendfsync everysec`.
- If your priority is minimizing acknowledged-write loss on crash, use AOF with `appendfsync always` and benchmark first.
- If your jobs trigger irreversible external side effects, make handlers idempotent and store your own deduplication / business keys.
- Treat failover as an availability feature, not proof of zero-loss durability.
