## Shared Client

By default, each glide-mq component creates its own GLIDE client (one TCP connection). You can optionally inject a shared client to reduce connection count.

### Default behavior (dedicated connections)

```typescript
const connection = { addresses: [{ host: 'localhost', port: 6379 }] };

const queue  = new Queue('jobs', { connection });        // 1 connection
const flow   = new FlowProducer({ connection });          // 1 connection
const worker = new Worker('jobs', handler, { connection });// 2 connections (command + blocking)
const events = new QueueEvents('jobs', { connection });   // 1 connection
// Total: 5 TCP connections
```

### Shared client (opt-in)

```typescript
import { GlideClient } from '@glidemq/speedkey';

const client = await GlideClient.createClient({ addresses: [{ host: 'localhost' }] });
const connection = { addresses: [{ host: 'localhost' }] };

const queue  = new Queue('jobs', { client });
const flow   = new FlowProducer({ client });
const worker = new Worker('jobs', handler, { connection, commandClient: client });
const events = new QueueEvents('jobs', { connection });
// Total: 2 TCP connections (shared + Worker's blocking client)
```

### What can share

Queue, FlowProducer, and Worker's command client all perform non-blocking operations (FCALL, HGET, ZADD, etc.) and can safely share a single GLIDE client. GLIDE's Rust core multiplexes commands over one TCP connection with up to 1000 concurrent in-flight requests.

### What cannot share

Worker's blocking client (`XREADGROUP BLOCK`) and QueueEvents (`XREAD BLOCK`) tie up the connection's read loop. These always get their own dedicated connection - you cannot inject a shared client into them.

QueueEvents will throw if you try to pass a `client`:

```typescript
// Throws: "QueueEvents does not accept an injected `client`"
new QueueEvents('jobs', { connection, client } as any);
```

### Tradeoffs

| | Dedicated (default) | Shared |
|---|---|---|
| **Connections** | N+2 per setup (1 per Queue/FlowProducer + 2 per Worker + 1 per QueueEvents) | 2 (shared + blocking) |
| **Throughput** | Baseline | Same or slightly better (fewer NAPI wake callbacks) |
| **Latency** | Baseline | Same (p50/p95/p99 identical in benchmarks) |
| **Isolation** | Each component has its own connection - failures are independent | All components sharing a client are affected by a disconnect |
| **Reconnection** | Each component reconnects independently | Worker emits error if shared client is unreachable - you manage reconnection |
| **Lifecycle** | Component creates and closes its own client | You create the client, you close it. `close()` on a component does not destroy the shared client. |
| **Simplicity** | Pass `connection` - done | Must create client upfront, pass it around, close in correct order |
| **Memory** | Slightly higher (N client objects + Rust state machines) | Lower (1 client object shared) |

### When to use shared

- Many Queue instances pointing to different queue names (e.g., multi-tenant routing)
- Queue + FlowProducer on the same process - saves 1 connection
- Connection count is a concern (cloud Valkey with connection limits)

### When to stick with dedicated

- Simple setup with one Queue and one Worker - the default is fine
- You want full isolation between components
- You don't want to manage client lifecycle manually

### Constraints

- **Worker always requires `connection`** even when `commandClient` is provided, because the blocking client must be auto-created.
- **Don't close the shared client while components are alive.** Close components first, then the client.
- **Don't mutate shared client state externally** (e.g., `SELECT` to change database).
- **`commandClient` and `client` are aliases on Worker** - provide one or the other, not both.

### Close order

```typescript
// Correct: close components first, then shared client
await queue.close();    // detaches from shared client (does not close it)
await worker.close();   // closes only the auto-created blocking client
await flow.close();     // detaches from shared client
client.close();         // now safe - no components using it
```

### Producer with an external client

`Producer` also supports external client injection. When `opts.client` is provided the Producer borrows the connection without taking ownership - `close()` will not destroy it. This is the recommended pattern for serverless environments where the connection lifecycle must align with the request lifecycle:

```typescript
import { GlideClient } from '@glidemq/speedkey';
import { Producer } from 'glide-mq';

export async function handler(event) {
  const client = await GlideClient.createClient({ addresses: [{ host: process.env.VALKEY_HOST }] });
  const producer = new Producer('jobs', { client });

  for (const job of event.jobs) {
    await producer.add(job.name, job.data);
  }

  // producer.close() does NOT close the client when client was injected
  await producer.close();
  client.close(); // caller owns lifecycle
}
```

For connection reuse across warm invocations, use `ServerlessPool` instead - see [Serverless](./serverless).

### `inflightRequestsLimit`

GLIDE defaults to 1000 concurrent in-flight requests per client. For high-concurrency setups, you can tune this:

```typescript
const connection = {
  addresses: [{ host: 'localhost' }],
  inflightRequestsLimit: 2000,
};
```

At Worker concurrency=50, peak inflight is ~55 commands. The 1000 default supports up to ~950 concurrent job activations across all components sharing one client.

---

## Job Schedulers

Use `upsertJobScheduler` to define repeatable jobs driven by a cron expression or a fixed interval. Schedulers survive worker restarts - the next run time is stored in Valkey.

```typescript
const queue = new Queue('tasks', { connection });

// Cron: run "daily-report" every day at 08:00 UTC
await queue.upsertJobScheduler(
  'daily-report',
  { pattern: '0 8 * * *' },
  { name: 'generate-report', data: { type: 'daily' } },
);

// Bound a scheduler to a campaign window and stop after 36 runs
await queue.upsertJobScheduler(
  'black-friday-deals',
  {
    pattern: '0 */2 * * *',
    startDate: new Date('2026-11-28T00:00:00Z'),
    endDate: new Date('2026-12-01T00:00:00Z'),
    limit: 36,
  },
  { name: 'promote-deal', data: { campaign: 'black-friday' } },
);

// Interval: run "cleanup" every 5 minutes
await queue.upsertJobScheduler(
  'cleanup',
  { every: 5 * 60 * 1_000 },  // ms
  { name: 'cleanup-old-records', data: {} },
);

// List all registered schedulers
const schedulers = await queue.getRepeatableJobs();

// Remove a scheduler (does not cancel jobs already in flight)
await queue.removeJobScheduler('cleanup');
```

### Repeat-after-complete mode

`repeatAfterComplete` schedules the next job only after the current one completes (or terminally fails). Unlike `every`, which fires at fixed intervals regardless of processing time, `repeatAfterComplete` ensures no overlap between successive runs.

```typescript
// Poll a sensor every 5 seconds after the previous poll finishes
await queue.upsertJobScheduler('sensor-poll', {
  repeatAfterComplete: 5000, // 5s after previous job completes
}, { name: 'poll', data: { sensor: 'temp-1' } });
```

This mode is useful for:

- **Polling** - avoid stacking requests when the upstream is slow.
- **Sequential pipelines** - each step must finish before the next begins.
- **Adaptive intervals** - combine with a custom processor that adjusts `repeatAfterComplete` via `upsertJobScheduler` based on results.

`repeatAfterComplete` is mutually exclusive with `pattern` and `every`. Bounded options (`startDate`, `endDate`, `limit`) work normally with this mode.

### Bounded schedulers

All three scheduler modes (`pattern`, `every`, `repeatAfterComplete`) support bounding via `startDate`, `endDate`, and `limit`:

| Option | Type | Effect |
|--------|------|--------|
| `startDate` | `Date \| number` | Defer the first eligible run until this time. |
| `endDate` | `Date \| number` | Auto-remove the scheduler when the next scheduled time would exceed this date. |
| `limit` | `number` | Auto-remove the scheduler after creating this many jobs. |

```typescript
// Run a cron job during a specific campaign window, max 36 runs
await queue.upsertJobScheduler(
  'black-friday-deals',
  {
    pattern: '0 */2 * * *',
    startDate: new Date('2026-11-28T00:00:00Z'),
    endDate: new Date('2026-12-01T00:00:00Z'),
    limit: 36,
  },
  { name: 'promote-deal', data: { campaign: 'black-friday' } },
);

// Interval with a delayed start and a hard stop after 100 iterations
await queue.upsertJobScheduler(
  'warmup-cache',
  {
    every: 30_000,
    startDate: Date.now() + 60_000,  // first run delayed 1 minute
    endDate: new Date('2026-12-31'), // stop scheduling after this date
    limit: 100,                       // auto-remove after 100 runs
  },
  { name: 'warmup', data: { region: 'us-east' } },
);
```

`getJobScheduler()` / `getRepeatableJobs()` expose the stored bounds together with `iterationCount` so you can inspect how many runs have already fired.

The internal `Scheduler` class fires a promotion loop that converts due scheduler entries into real jobs, then re-registers the next occurrence.

---

## LIFO Mode

Set `lifo: true` in `JobOptions` to process jobs in last-in-first-out order. The most recently added job is picked up first.

```typescript
await queue.add('render', { frame: 100 }, { lifo: true });
await queue.add('render', { frame: 101 }, { lifo: true });
await queue.add('render', { frame: 102 }, { lifo: true });
// Processing order: 102, 101, 100
```

### Ordering precedence

Workers check sources in this order: **priority > LIFO > FIFO**. Priority jobs (those with `priority > 0`) are always fetched first. Among non-priority jobs, LIFO jobs are fetched before FIFO jobs sitting in the stream.

### Constraints

- **Cannot combine with `ordering.key`.** Throws at enqueue time:
  ```
  Error: lifo and ordering.key cannot be used together
  ```
- LIFO jobs are stored in a dedicated Valkey LIST (`glide:{queueName}:lifo`), separate from the main stream. This means LIFO and FIFO jobs in the same queue coexist - LIFO jobs are drained first.
- Under `concurrency > 1`, multiple LIFO jobs may run in parallel; strict reverse ordering is only guaranteed with `concurrency: 1`.
- Works with all job types: delayed jobs return to the LIFO list after their delay expires, and schedulers can produce LIFO jobs via the template `opts`.

See also: [Adding jobs](./usage#adding-jobs) for the full `JobOptions` reference.

---

## Job TTL

Set `ttl` in `JobOptions` to auto-expire jobs that are not processed within a time window. The value is in milliseconds.

```typescript
// Expire if not processed within 30 seconds
await queue.add('time-sensitive', { alert: 'server-down' }, {
  ttl: 30_000,
});

// TTL works with delayed jobs — the clock starts at creation time
await queue.add('offer', { code: 'FLASH50' }, {
  delay: 5_000,
  ttl: 60_000, // must be processed within 60s of creation, not of becoming active
});

// TTL works with priority jobs
await queue.add('urgent', data, {
  priority: 1,
  ttl: 10_000,
});
```

When a job's TTL elapses, it is failed with the reason `'expired'` during the next activation check. Jobs that are already active are not interrupted - TTL is checked at fetch time, not mid-processing. Use `timeout` in `JobOptions` to limit active processing time.

See also: [Adding jobs](./usage#adding-jobs) for other per-job options.

---

## Pluggable Serializers

By default, glide-mq uses `JSON.stringify` / `JSON.parse` for job data, return values, and progress payloads. You can replace this with any synchronous serializer.

### The `Serializer` interface

```typescript
import type { Serializer } from 'glide-mq';

interface Serializer {
  /** Serialize a value to a string for storage in Valkey. */
  serialize(data: unknown): string;
  /** Deserialize a string from Valkey back to a value. */
  deserialize(raw: string): unknown;
}
```

Both methods must be synchronous. If `serialize` throws, the job is treated as a processor failure (in Worker) or skipped (in Scheduler).

### Example: MessagePack serializer

```typescript
import { Queue, Worker } from 'glide-mq';
import { encode, decode } from '@msgpack/msgpack';

const msgpackSerializer: Serializer = {
  serialize: (data) => Buffer.from(encode(data)).toString('base64'),
  deserialize: (raw) => decode(Buffer.from(raw, 'base64')),
};

const queue = new Queue('tasks', {
  connection,
  serializer: msgpackSerializer,
});

const worker = new Worker('tasks', processor, {
  connection,
  serializer: msgpackSerializer, // must match the Queue
});
```

### What is serialized

The serializer is applied to:

- **`data`** - the job payload passed to `queue.add()`.
- **`returnvalue`** - the value returned by the processor.
- **`progress`** - the value passed to `job.updateProgress()`.

### Consistency requirement

The same serializer must be configured on every Queue, Worker, and FlowProducer instance that operates on the same queue. A mismatch causes silent data corruption - the consumer will see `{}` and the job's `deserializationFailed` flag will be `true`.

### Default export

The built-in JSON serializer is exported for use in conditional logic or testing:

```typescript
import { JSON_SERIALIZER } from 'glide-mq';

const serializer = process.env.USE_MSGPACK === '1'
  ? msgpackSerializer
  : JSON_SERIALIZER;

const queue = new Queue('tasks', { connection, serializer });
```

See also: [Worker](./usage#worker) and [Queue](./usage#queue) for where `serializer` appears in options.

---

## Ordering and Group Concurrency

### Sequential processing (concurrency=1)

Add `ordering.key` to a job to guarantee that all jobs with the same key are processed one at a time, in the order they were added.

```typescript
// All jobs with ordering.key = 'user:42' are processed sequentially
await queue.add('process-payment', { userId: 42, amount: 100 }, {
  ordering: { key: 'user:42' },
});
await queue.add('send-receipt', { userId: 42 }, {
  ordering: { key: 'user:42' },
});
```

### Group concurrency (concurrency > 1)

Set `ordering.concurrency` to allow up to N jobs per key to run in parallel across all workers:

```typescript
// Max 3 concurrent jobs for tenant-42, regardless of worker count
await queue.add('process', data, {
  ordering: { key: 'tenant-42', concurrency: 3 },
});
```

Jobs exceeding the group limit are parked in a per-group wait list and automatically released when a slot opens.

```typescript
// Multi-tenant isolation: each client gets max 2 concurrent jobs
for (const job of jobs) {
  await queue.add('task', job.data, {
    ordering: { key: `client-${job.clientId}`, concurrency: 2 },
  });
}
```

### Per-group rate limiting

Limit how many jobs per ordering key can start within a time window, independent of concurrency:

```typescript
// Max 10 jobs per 60 seconds for each tenant
await queue.add('sync', data, {
  ordering: {
    key: `tenant-${tenantId}`,
    concurrency: 3,
    rateLimit: { max: 10, duration: 60_000 },
  },
});
```

When both `concurrency` and `rateLimit` are set, both gates apply - a job must have a free concurrency slot *and* remaining rate capacity to start. Jobs that hit the rate limit are parked in a scheduler-managed promotion queue and released when the window resets.

- **Promotion latency**: rate-limited jobs are promoted by the scheduler loop. Worst-case latency is one `promotionInterval` (default 5 s). Lower `promotionInterval` on the worker if tighter latency is needed.
- **Retried jobs consume rate slots** - a retried job counts against the rate window like any new job.

### Token bucket rate limiting

Use `ordering.tokenBucket` to enforce cost-based rate limiting per ordering key. Unlike the sliding window (`rateLimit`), which counts jobs, the token bucket assigns a `cost` to each job and deducts from a refilling bucket:

```typescript
// Each API call costs 1 token (default), bulk exports cost 10
await queue.add('api-call', data, {
  ordering: {
    key: `tenant-${tenantId}`,
    concurrency: 5,
    tokenBucket: { capacity: 100, refillRate: 10 }, // 100 tokens max, 10 tokens/s
  },
  cost: 1,
});

await queue.add('bulk-export', data, {
  ordering: {
    key: `tenant-${tenantId}`,
    concurrency: 5,
    tokenBucket: { capacity: 100, refillRate: 10 },
  },
  cost: 10, // consumes 10 tokens
});
```

**How it works**: tokens refill at `refillRate` tokens per second up to `capacity`. When a job is activated, its `cost` is deducted from the bucket. If insufficient tokens remain, the job is parked and promoted once enough tokens have refilled. Internally, tokens are tracked as millitokens (1 token = 1000 millitokens) for sub-integer precision.

**Check order**: when both concurrency, token bucket, and sliding window are configured, the gates are checked in order: concurrency -> token bucket -> sliding window. All applicable limits must pass. Strict FIFO is maintained - jobs never skip ahead of earlier jobs in the same group.

**Cost validation**: a job with `cost` greater than `capacity` is rejected at enqueue time. If a previously valid job becomes invalid (e.g., capacity was lowered), it is moved to the DLQ at activation.

**Differences from sliding window** (`rateLimit`):

| | Sliding window (`rateLimit`) | Token bucket (`tokenBucket`) |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | Job count | Weighted cost per job |
| Config | `{ max, duration }` | `{ capacity, refillRate }` |
| Default cost | 1 job | `cost: 1` token |
| Refill | Window resets after `duration` ms | Continuous refill at `refillRate`/s |
| Use case | "Max N jobs per window" | "Max N units of work per second" |

- **Promotion latency**: same as sliding window - worst-case one `promotionInterval` (default 5 s).
- **Composition**: token bucket composes with concurrency, sliding window, and global rate limits. All gates are enforced.

### Runtime group rate limiting

The static rate limits above (`rateLimit`, `tokenBucket`) are set at enqueue time. For dynamic scenarios - like a crawler hitting a 429 response - use runtime rate limiting to pause a specific group from inside or outside the processor.

#### From inside the processor

```typescript
const worker = new Worker('crawl', async (job) => {
  const res = await fetch(job.data.url);
  if (res.status === 429) {
    const retryAfter = parseInt(res.headers.get('retry-after') || '60') * 1000;
    // Pause this domain group - other domains keep processing
    await job.rateLimitGroup(retryAfter);
  }
  return { html: await res.text() };
}, { connection });
```

`job.rateLimitGroup(duration, opts?)` re-parks the current job in the group queue and pauses the entire group for `duration` milliseconds. The job resumes automatically when the duration expires.

#### Throw-style sugar

```typescript
import { GroupRateLimitError } from 'glide-mq';

const worker = new Worker('crawl', async (job) => {
  const res = await fetch(job.data.url);
  if (res.status === 429) {
    throw new GroupRateLimitError(60_000);
  }
  return res.text();
}, { connection });
```

#### From outside the processor

```typescript
// From a webhook, health check, or admin API
await queue.rateLimitGroup('example.com', 60_000);
```

`queue.rateLimitGroup(groupKey, duration, opts?)` registers the group as rate-limited. Jobs already in the group queue are held until the duration expires.

#### Options

All three APIs accept the same options:

| Option | Values | Default | Description |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `currentJob` | `'requeue'` \| `'fail'` | `'requeue'` | Re-park the job (no retry consumed) or fail it |
| `requeuePosition` | `'front'` \| `'back'` | `'front'` | Where to place the re-parked job in the group queue |
| `extend` | `'max'` \| `'replace'` | `'max'` | Never shorten an existing pause, or overwrite it |

```typescript
await job.rateLimitGroup(30_000, {
  currentJob: 'requeue',     // default: re-park without consuming retry
  requeuePosition: 'front',  // default: this job resumes first
  extend: 'max',             // default: if already paused for longer, keep the longer pause
});
```

#### How it works

1. The current job is atomically re-parked in the per-group ZSET queue
2. The group is registered in the `ratelimited` sorted set with a resume timestamp
3. The scheduler's promotion loop (`promoteRateLimited`) checks this set on every cycle
4. When the resume timestamp passes, queued jobs are promoted back to the stream
5. The re-parked job resumes as a "returning" activation - no ordering violations

### Notes

- Jobs with different ordering keys (or no ordering key) are processed concurrently as normal.
- Ordering keys are limited to 256 characters.
- `concurrency=1` (or omitted) preserves strict FIFO ordering per key.
- `concurrency > 1` caps parallelism but does not guarantee FIFO within the group.
- Group concurrency and global concurrency (`setGlobalConcurrency`) compose: both limits are enforced.
- Per-group rate limiting, token bucket, group concurrency, and global concurrency all compose: all applicable limits are enforced.
- Group slots are released on job complete, fail, retry, DLQ move, and stall recovery.

---

## Custom Job IDs

By default glide-mq assigns a monotonically increasing integer ID to each job. You can supply your own ID via `opts.jobId` to get deterministic, idempotent job creation:

```typescript
// Deterministic job: safe to call multiple times
const job = await queue.add('send-email', { to: 'user@example.com' }, {
  jobId: 'email-user-42',
});
// job is null if a job with this ID already exists (silent skip)
```

**Constraints**

- Max 256 characters.
- Must not contain control characters (U+0000-U+001F, U+007F), curly braces (`{`, `}`), or colons (`:`).
- Violating either constraint throws synchronously before the network call.

**Duplicate behaviour by surface**

| Surface | Behaviour on duplicate ID |
|---------|--------------------------|
| `Queue.add` | Returns `null` (silent skip) |
| `Queue.addBulk` | Silently omits the duplicate from the returned array |
| `FlowProducer.add` | Throws - flows cannot be partially created |
| `TestQueue.add` | Returns `null` (mirrors production) |

**Interaction with deduplication**

`opts.jobId` and `opts.deduplication` are independent mechanisms. When both are set the deduplication check runs first; if the job is deduplicated, the custom ID is never stored. If the dedup check passes, the custom ID collision check runs next.

---

## Deduplication

Prevent duplicate jobs from entering the queue using `deduplication.id`. Three modes are supported:

| Mode | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| `simple` | Skip the new job if any job with the same ID already exists (any state). |
| `throttle` | Accept only the first job in a TTL window; later arrivals are dropped. |
| `debounce` | Accept only the last job in a TTL window; earlier arrivals are cancelled. |

```typescript
// Simple: skip if a job with this ID is already queued / active / completed
await queue.add('send-welcome', { userId: 99 }, {
  deduplication: { id: 'welcome-99', mode: 'simple' },
});

// Throttle: at most one "sync" job per 10 s
await queue.add('sync', { region: 'eu' }, {
  deduplication: { id: 'sync-eu', mode: 'throttle', ttl: 10_000 },
});

// Debounce: only the last "search" job within 500 ms is actually queued
await queue.add('search', { query: 'hello' }, {
  deduplication: { id: 'search-user-1', mode: 'debounce', ttl: 500 },
});
```

`queue.add()` returns `null` when a job is skipped by deduplication.

---

## Global Concurrency

Limit the total number of concurrently active jobs across **all workers** sharing a queue, regardless of per-worker `concurrency` settings.

```typescript
const queue = new Queue('tasks', { connection });

// Allow at most 20 active jobs across all workers at once
await queue.setGlobalConcurrency(20);

// Remove the limit
await queue.setGlobalConcurrency(0);
```

Workers check this limit atomically before picking up each job via the `checkConcurrency` server function.

---

## Global Rate Limiting

Cap the total job throughput across all workers sharing a queue. The config is stored in the Valkey meta hash and picked up dynamically by workers within one scheduler tick.

```typescript
const queue = new Queue('tasks', { connection });

// Max 500 jobs per minute across all workers
await queue.setGlobalRateLimit({ max: 500, duration: 60_000 });

// Read current config
const limit = await queue.getGlobalRateLimit();
// { max: 500, duration: 60000 } or null if not set

// Remove the limit
await queue.removeGlobalRateLimit();
```

- Global rate limit takes precedence over `WorkerOptions.limiter`. When both are set, the stricter limit wins.
- Changes are picked up by workers within one scheduler tick (no restart needed).

---

## Job Revocation

Cooperatively cancel a job that is waiting, delayed, or currently being processed.

```typescript
const job = await queue.add('long-task', { input: 'data' });

// Later...
const result = await queue.revoke(job.id);
// 'revoked'  — job was waiting/delayed and is now in the failed set
// 'flagged'  — job is active; the worker will abort it cooperatively
// 'not_found'— job does not exist
```

In your processor, use `job.abortSignal` to react to revocation:

```typescript
const worker = new Worker('tasks', async (job) => {
  for (const chunk of largeDataset) {
    if (job.abortSignal?.aborted) {
      throw new Error('Job revoked');
    }
    await processChunk(chunk);
  }
  return { done: true };
}, { connection });
```

`job.abortSignal` is an [`AbortSignal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal). You can pass it directly to `fetch`, `axios`, or any `AbortSignal`-aware API.

---

## Transparent Compression

Enable gzip compression at the queue level. Workers decompress automatically - no changes required in processors.

```typescript
const queue = new Queue('tasks', {
  connection,
  compression: 'gzip',
});

// Payload is gzip-compressed before storing in Valkey
await queue.add('process-large', { report: '... 15 KB of data ...' });
// Stored size: ~300 bytes (98% savings on repetitive data)
```

**Payload size limit:** job data must be ≤ 1 MB *after* serialisation but *before* compression. Larger payloads throw immediately:

```
Error: Job data exceeds maximum size (1234567 bytes > 1MB).
       Use smaller payloads or store large data externally.
```

Store large blobs in S3/GCS/object storage and pass a reference URL in the job data instead.

---

## Retries and Backoff

Configure retry behaviour per job via `attempts` and `backoff`:

```typescript
await queue.add('send-email', data, {
  attempts: 5,
  backoff: { type: 'exponential', delay: 1_000 },
  // delay sequence: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s (capped at attempts)
});

// Fixed delay
await queue.add('webhook', data, {
  attempts: 3,
  backoff: { type: 'fixed', delay: 2_000 },
});

// Exponential with jitter (avoids thundering herd)
await queue.add('poll', data, {
  attempts: 10,
  backoff: { type: 'exponential', delay: 500, jitter: 0.1 },
});

// Custom strategy — register on the Worker
const worker = new Worker('tasks', processor, {
  connection,
  backoffStrategies: {
    'rate-limited': (attemptsMade, err) => {
      // Respect Retry-After header
      if (err.retryAfter) return err.retryAfter * 1_000;
      return attemptsMade * 3_000;
    },
  },
});

await queue.add('api-call', data, {
  attempts: 5,
  backoff: { type: 'rate-limited', delay: 0 },
});
```

When `attempts` is exhausted the job moves to the `failed` state (or the DLQ if configured).

## Dead Letter Queues

Route permanently failed jobs to a separate queue for later inspection or manual retry.

```typescript
const worker = new Worker('tasks', processor, {
  connection,
  deadLetterQueue: { name: 'tasks-dlq' },
});

// Inspect DLQ contents
const dlqQueue = new Queue('tasks-dlq', { connection });
const failedJobs = await dlqQueue.getJobs('waiting');

// Or use the convenience method on the original queue
const dlqJobs = await queue.getDeadLetterJobs(0, 49);
```

Jobs in the DLQ are ordinary jobs - you can inspect, retry, or remove them like any other job.

---

## Fallback Chains

Define an ordered list of model/provider alternatives tried automatically on retryable failure. When a job fails and has remaining attempts, the `fallbackIndex` increments and the processor reads `job.currentFallback` to determine which model to use.

```typescript
await queue.add('inference', {
  prompt: 'Summarize this document.',
  primaryModel: 'gpt-5.4',
}, {
  attempts: 4,
  backoff: { type: 'exponential', delay: 1000 },
  fallbacks: [
    { model: 'gpt-5.4-nano', provider: 'openai' },
    { model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514', provider: 'anthropic' },
    { model: 'gemini-2.5-pro', provider: 'google' },
  ],
});
```

In the processor:

```typescript
const worker = new Worker('inference', async (job) => {
  const fallback = job.currentFallback;
  const model = fallback ? fallback.model : job.data.primaryModel;

  const result = await callLLM(model, job.data.prompt);
  await job.reportUsage({ model, tokens: { input: result.inTokens, output: result.outTokens } });
  return { content: result.text, model };
}, { connection });
```

- `fallbackIndex=0`: original attempt (`currentFallback` is `undefined`)
- `fallbackIndex=1`: first retry (`currentFallback` = `fallbacks[0]`)
- `fallbackIndex=N`: Nth retry (`currentFallback` = `fallbacks[N-1]`)

Each entry supports an optional `metadata` field for custom routing logic. See [AI-Native Features: Fallback Chains](./ai-native#fallback-chains) for the full guide.

## Dual-Axis Rate Limiting

Enforce RPM (requests per minute) and TPM (tokens per minute) simultaneously to comply with LLM provider rate limits.

### RPM limiting (existing `limiter`)

```typescript
const worker = new Worker('inference', processor, {
  connection,
  limiter: { max: 60, duration: 60_000 },  // 60 req/min
});
```

### TPM limiting (`tokenLimiter`)

```typescript
const worker = new Worker('inference', processor, {
  connection,
  tokenLimiter: {
    maxTokens: 100_000,   // 100K tokens per minute
    duration: 60_000,
    scope: 'both',        // 'queue' | 'worker' | 'both'
  },
});
```

### Combined

```typescript
const worker = new Worker('inference', processor, {
  connection,
  concurrency: 10,
  limiter: { max: 60, duration: 60_000 },
  tokenLimiter: { maxTokens: 100_000, duration: 60_000 },
});
```

The processor must call `job.reportTokens(count)` for the TPM limiter to track consumption:

```typescript
const worker = new Worker('inference', async (job) => {
  const result = await callLLM(job.data.prompt);
  await job.reportTokens(result.totalTokens);
  return result;
}, { connection, tokenLimiter: { maxTokens: 50_000, duration: 60_000 } });
```

When either limit is exceeded, the worker pauses fetching new jobs until the window resets. Active jobs are not interrupted.

**Scope options:**

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `'queue'` | Shared Valkey counter across all workers |
| `'worker'` | In-memory counter per worker instance |
| `'both'` (default) | Local check first, Valkey check when near limit |

See [AI-Native Features: Dual-Axis Rate Limiting](./ai-native#dual-axis-rate-limiting) for the full guide.

## Per-Job Lock Duration

Override the worker-level `lockDuration` for individual jobs. Essential for AI workloads where inference latency varies widely.

```typescript
// Fast embedding - 5 second lock, fast stall detection
await queue.add('embed', { text: 'hello' }, {
  lockDuration: 5_000,
});

// Slow generation - 60 second lock to avoid false stalls
await queue.add('generate', { prompt: 'Write an essay...' }, {
  lockDuration: 60_000,
});
```

The lock duration controls heartbeat frequency (`lockDuration / 2`) and the stall detection threshold. Without per-job lock, you must set the worker's `lockDuration` high enough for the slowest job, which degrades stall detection for fast jobs.

---

## Vector Search

Create a Valkey Search index over job hashes and query by vector similarity (KNN). Requires the `valkey-search` module on the server.

```typescript
// Create index with vector field
await queue.createJobIndex({
  vectorField: { name: 'embedding', dimensions: 1536, distanceMetric: 'COSINE' },
  fields: [{ type: 'TAG', name: 'category' }],
});

// Store vector on a job
const job = await queue.add('doc', { title: 'Queue Basics', category: 'infra' });
await job.storeVector('embedding', embeddingVector);

// KNN search with pre-filter
const results = await queue.vectorSearch(queryVector, {
  k: 10,
  filter: '@category:{infra}',
});
```

See the dedicated [Vector Search guide](./vector-search) for full details.
