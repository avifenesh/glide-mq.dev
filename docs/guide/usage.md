## Queue

Create a queue by passing a name and a connection config.

```typescript
import { Queue } from 'glide-mq';

const connection = { addresses: [{ host: 'localhost', port: 6379 }] };
const queue = new Queue('tasks', { connection });
```

### Adding jobs

```typescript
// Single job
const job = await queue.add('send-email', { to: 'user@example.com' });

// With options
await queue.add(
  'send-email',
  { to: 'user@example.com' },
  {
    delay: 5_000, // run after 5 s
    priority: 1, // 1 = highest, up to 2048; 0 (default) = no priority, runs after prioritized jobs
    attempts: 3, // run at most 3 times total (initial + 2 retries)
    backoff: { type: 'exponential', delay: 1_000 },
    timeout: 30_000, // fail job if processor exceeds 30 s
    removeOnComplete: true, // auto-remove on success (or { age, count })
    removeOnFail: false, // keep failed jobs for inspection
  },
);

// Bulk add  -  12.7× faster than serial via GLIDE Batch API
await queue.addBulk([
  { name: 'job1', data: { a: 1 } },
  { name: 'job2', data: { a: 2 } },
]);
```

#### LIFO mode

Add `lifo: true` so the newest jobs are processed first. LIFO jobs are stored in a dedicated Valkey LIST (RPUSH/RPOP) separate from the default FIFO stream.

```typescript
await queue.add('urgent-report', data, { lifo: true });
```

Processing order: **priority > LIFO > FIFO**. Priority jobs are always consumed first, then LIFO, then the normal FIFO stream. `lifo` cannot be combined with `ordering` keys  -  they are mutually exclusive.

#### Job TTL

`ttl` (milliseconds) sets a time-to-live on a job. If the job is not processed within this window, it is automatically failed as `'expired'`.

```typescript
// Expire if not processed within 5 minutes
await queue.add('temp', data, { ttl: 300_000 });
```

### Inspecting jobs

```typescript
const job = await queue.getJob('42');

// By state, with optional pagination
const waiting = await queue.getJobs('waiting', 0, 49);
const active = await queue.getJobs('active', 0, 49);
const delayed = await queue.getJobs('delayed', 0, 49);
const done = await queue.getJobs('completed', 0, 49);
const failed = await queue.getJobs('failed', 0, 49);

// Fetch metadata only (omit data and returnvalue) - useful for dashboards
const lite = await queue.getJobs('waiting', 0, 99, { excludeData: true });
const meta = await queue.getJob('42', { excludeData: true });
// lite[0].data === undefined, lite[0].name / .timestamp / .id still present
```

### Queue counts

```typescript
const counts = await queue.getJobCounts();
// { waiting, active, delayed, completed, failed }
```

### Time-series metrics

Get per-minute throughput and latency data for completed or failed jobs:

```typescript
const metrics = await queue.getMetrics('completed');
// {
//   count: 15234,
//   data: [
//     { timestamp: 1709654400000, count: 142, avgDuration: 234 },
//     { timestamp: 1709654460000, count: 156, avgDuration: 218 },
//   ],
//   meta: { resolution: 'minute' }
// }

// Slice data points (e.g. last 10 data points):
const recent = await queue.getMetrics('completed', { start: -10 });
```

Data points are recorded server-side inside the Valkey functions with zero extra RTTs. Minute-resolution buckets are retained for 24 hours and trimmed automatically.

### Pause / resume

```typescript
await queue.pause(); // workers stop picking up new jobs
await queue.resume(); // resume normal operation
const paused = await queue.isPaused();
```

### Drain and obliterate

```typescript
// Remove all waiting jobs (keeps active jobs running)
await queue.drain(); // remove waiting jobs only
await queue.drain(true); // also remove delayed/scheduled jobs

// Remove ALL queue data from Valkey
await queue.obliterate(); // fails if there are active jobs (stream or priority/LIFO)
await queue.obliterate({ force: true }); // unconditional wipe
```

The active-job check counts both the stream's pending entries and active priority/LIFO claims.

### Cleaning old jobs

Remove completed or failed jobs that are older than a given grace period:

```typescript
// Remove completed jobs older than 1 hour, up to 1000 at a time
const removedIds = await queue.clean(60_000 * 60, 1000, 'completed');

// Remove failed jobs older than 24 hours, up to 500 at a time
const removedFailedIds = await queue.clean(60_000 * 60 * 24, 500, 'failed');

console.log(`Cleaned ${removedIds.length} completed jobs`);
```

- `grace`  -  minimum age in milliseconds; jobs finished more recently are kept.
- `limit`  -  maximum number of jobs to remove per call.
- `type`  -  `'completed'` or `'failed'`.

Returns an array of the removed job IDs.

### Closing

```typescript
await queue.close();
```

---

## Worker

Create a worker with a name, an async processor function, and options.

```typescript
import { Worker } from 'glide-mq';

const worker = new Worker(
  'tasks',
  async (job) => {
    // job.data is typed if you use generics: Worker<MyData, MyResult>
    console.log('Processing', job.name, job.data);

    await job.log('step 1 done'); // append to job log
    await job.updateProgress(50); // broadcast progress (0–100 or object)
    await job.updateData({ ...job.data, enriched: true });

    // Permanently fail a job without consuming retries (two equivalent approaches):
    // 1. Imperative: call job.discard() then throw
    if (job.data.poison) {
      job.discard();
      throw new Error('poisoned job - discarded');
    }
    // 2. Declarative: throw UnrecoverableError - same effect, no discard() needed
    // import { UnrecoverableError } from 'glide-mq';
    // throw new UnrecoverableError('bad input - will not retry');

    return { ok: true }; // becomes job.returnvalue
  },
  {
    connection,
    concurrency: 10, // process up to 10 jobs in parallel (default: 1)
    blockTimeout: 5_000, // XREADGROUP BLOCK timeout in ms
    stalledInterval: 30_000, // how often the scheduler checks for stalled jobs (cadence)
    lockDuration: 30_000, // stall detection window per job (threshold) - jobs idle this long are reclaimed
    limiter: { max: 100, duration: 60_000 }, // rate limit: 100 jobs / min
    deadLetterQueue: { name: 'dlq' }, // inherited from QueueOptions - can also set on Queue constructor
    backoffStrategies: {
      // custom strategy called as: custom(attemptsMade, err) => delayMs
      custom: (attemptsMade) => attemptsMade * 2_000,
    },
  },
);
```

### Worker events

```typescript
worker.on('active', (job, jobId) => {
  console.log(`Job ${jobId} started processing`);
});

worker.on('completed', (job, result) => {
  console.log(`Job ${job.id} finished`, result);
});

worker.on('failed', (job, err) => {
  console.error(`Job ${job.id} failed:`, err.message);
});

worker.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error('Worker error', err);
});

worker.on('stalled', (jobId, prev) => {
  console.warn(`Job ${jobId} stalled (was ${prev}) and was re-queued`);
});

worker.on('drained', () => {
  console.log('Queue is empty  -  no more jobs waiting');
});
```

| Event       | Arguments       | Description                                     |
| ----------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `active`    | `(job, jobId)`  | Fired when a job starts processing              |
| `completed` | `(job, result)` | Fired when a job finishes successfully          |
| `failed`    | `(job, err)`    | Fired when a job throws or times out            |
| `error`     | `(err)`         | Internal worker error (connection issues, etc.) |
| `stalled`   | `(jobId, prev)` | Job exceeded lock duration and was re-queued    |
| `drained`   | `()`            | Queue transitioned from non-empty to empty      |
| `closing`   | `()`            | Worker is beginning to close                    |
| `closed`    | `()`            | Worker has fully closed                         |

A worker emits `stalled` for each job its own stalled check returned to waiting (`prev` is `'active'`). A job past `maxStalledCount` is failed instead and gets no `stalled`. Every stalled recovery also writes a `stalled` event to the events stream, so `QueueEvents` (`events.on('stalled', ({ jobId }) => ...)`) sees stalls found by any worker.

### Pausing / closing a worker

```typescript
await worker.pause(); // stop accepting new jobs (active ones finish)
await worker.pause(true); // force-stop immediately
await worker.resume();

await worker.close(); // graceful: waits for active jobs and the in-flight blocking read (up to blockTimeout)
await worker.close(true); // force-close now: aborts job.abortSignal, running jobs are left for stalled recovery
```

---

## Graceful Shutdown

`gracefulShutdown` registers `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` handlers and resolves once all passed components have closed. A second signal while shutdown is still running removes the handlers and re-raises the signal, so a hung close cannot block exit.

```typescript
import { Queue, Worker, QueueEvents, gracefulShutdown } from 'glide-mq';

const queue = new Queue('tasks', { connection });
const worker = new Worker('tasks', processor, { connection });
const events = new QueueEvents('tasks', { connection });

// Waits for all components to close before the process exits
await gracefulShutdown([queue, worker, events]);
```

Pass any mix of `Queue`, `Worker`, and `QueueEvents` instances. Each receives a `close()` call when a signal is received.

---

## Cluster Mode

Set `clusterMode: true` in the connection config. Everything else is the same  -  keys are hash-tagged automatically.

```typescript
import { Queue, Worker } from 'glide-mq';

const connection = {
  addresses: [
    { host: 'node1', port: 7000 },
    { host: 'node2', port: 7001 },
  ],
  clusterMode: true,
  // Optional: route reads to same-AZ replicas (AWS ElastiCache / MemoryDB)
  readFrom: 'AZAffinity',
  clientAz: 'us-east-1a',
};

const queue = new Queue('tasks', { connection });
const worker = new Worker('tasks', processor, { connection });
```

### IAM authentication (ElastiCache / MemoryDB)

```typescript
const connection = {
  addresses: [{ host: 'my-cluster.cache.amazonaws.com', port: 6379 }],
  clusterMode: true,
  credentials: {
    type: 'iam',
    serviceType: 'elasticache', // or 'memorydb'
    region: 'us-east-1',
    userId: 'my-iam-user',
    clusterName: 'my-cluster',
  },
};
```

---

## Pluggable Serializers

By default, job data and return values are serialized with `JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse`. You can replace this with any serializer that implements the `Serializer` interface.

```typescript
import { Queue, Worker, JSON_SERIALIZER } from 'glide-mq';
import type { Serializer } from 'glide-mq';

const base64Serializer: Serializer = {
  serialize(data: unknown): string {
    return Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(data)).toString('base64');
  },
  deserialize(raw: string): unknown {
    return JSON.parse(Buffer.from(raw, 'base64').toString('utf8'));
  },
};

const queue = new Queue('tasks', { connection, serializer: base64Serializer });
const worker = new Worker('tasks', processor, { connection, serializer: base64Serializer });
```

Both `Queue` and `Worker` (and `FlowProducer`, if used) **must use the same serializer**. A mismatch causes silent data corruption  -  the consumer sees `{}` and the job's `deserializationFailed` flag is set to `true`.

`JSON_SERIALIZER` is the default and is exported for convenience (e.g., when you only need a custom serializer on a subset of queues).

---

## Broadcast / BroadcastWorker

`Broadcast` is a pub/sub fan-out primitive. Unlike `Queue` (point-to-point, each job processed by exactly one worker), `Broadcast` delivers every message to **all** subscribers.

```typescript
import { Broadcast, BroadcastWorker } from 'glide-mq';

const broadcast = new Broadcast('events', {
  connection,
  maxMessages: 1000, // retain at most 1000 messages in the stream
});

// Each subscriber is identified by a unique subscription name (becomes a consumer group)
const inventoryWorker = new BroadcastWorker(
  'events',
  async (job) => {
    console.log('Inventory update:', job.data);
  },
  { connection, subscription: 'inventory-service' },
);

const emailWorker = new BroadcastWorker(
  'events',
  async (job) => {
    console.log('Send notification:', job.data);
  },
  { connection, subscription: 'email-service' },
);

// Publish  -  every subscriber receives this message
await broadcast.publish('order.placed', { event: 'order.placed', orderId: 42 });
```

### BroadcastWorker options

Each `BroadcastWorker` supports the same options as `Worker` (concurrency, limiter, backoff, etc.) plus:

- `subscription` (required)  -  unique name for this subscriber. Becomes the consumer group.
- `startFrom`  -  stream ID to start reading from when the subscription is first created:
  - `'$'` (default)  -  only new messages published after subscription creation.
  - `'0-0'`  -  replay all retained history (backfill).

```typescript
const replayWorker = new BroadcastWorker('events', processor, {
  connection,
  subscription: 'analytics',
  startFrom: '0-0', // backfill all existing messages
  concurrency: 5,
});
```

### Queue vs Broadcast

|                 | Queue                         | Broadcast                                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Delivery        | Point-to-point (one consumer) | Fan-out (all subscribers)                 |
| Use case        | Task processing, job queues   | Event distribution, notifications         |
| Add / Publish   | `queue.add(name, data, opts)` | `broadcast.publish(subject, data, opts?)` |
| Consumer        | `Worker`                      | `BroadcastWorker`                         |
| Retry / backoff | Per job                       | Per subscriber, per message               |
| Stream trimming | Auto (completion/removal)     | `maxMessages` option                      |

---

## Event Listeners

### Disabling server-side events

For high-throughput workloads that don't consume `QueueEvents`, disable server-side event emission to save 1 redis.call() per job:

```typescript
// Queue - skip XADD 'added' event on add()
const queue = new Queue('tasks', { connection, events: false });

// Producer - same option
const producer = new Producer('tasks', { connection, events: false });

// Worker - skip XADD 'completed'/'failed'/'retrying' events on process
const worker = new Worker('tasks', handler, { connection, events: false });
```

With `metrics: false` a worker also skips the completed and failed metrics. Stalled recovery and delayed-job promotion still write their events (`stalled`, `promoted`). This only affects the Valkey events stream. TS-side `EventEmitter` events (`worker.on('completed', ...)`) are unaffected.

### `QueueEvents`  -  stream-based lifecycle events

`QueueEvents` subscribes to the queue's events stream via `XREAD BLOCK`, giving you real-time job lifecycle events without polling.

```typescript
import { QueueEvents } from 'glide-mq';

const events = new QueueEvents('tasks', { connection });

events.on('added', ({ jobId }) => console.log('added', jobId));
events.on('progress', ({ jobId, data }) => console.log('progress', jobId, data));
events.on('completed', ({ jobId, returnvalue }) => console.log('completed', jobId, returnvalue));
events.on('failed', ({ jobId, failedReason }) => console.log('failed', jobId, failedReason));
events.on('stalled', ({ jobId }) => console.log('stalled', jobId));
events.on('paused', () => console.log('queue paused'));
events.on('resumed', () => console.log('queue resumed'));

// Always close QueueEvents when done
await events.close();
```

### Waiting for a specific job to finish

```typescript
// wait until job completes or fails (polls the job hash at the given interval)
const state = await job.waitUntilFinished(500, 30000); // 'completed' | 'failed'
```

### Request-reply with `addAndWait()`

Use `queue.addAndWait()` when the producer needs the final worker result in the same request cycle without polling the job hash.

```typescript
const result = await queue.addAndWait('inference', { prompt: 'Hello', model: 'mini' }, { waitTimeout: 30_000 });

console.log(result);
```

Notes:

- `waitTimeout` is the producer-side wait budget. It is separate from the job’s own `timeout`, which still controls processor execution time.
- `addAndWait()` requires a real `connection` because it uses a dedicated blocking connection to wait on the queue events stream.
- `addAndWait()` is a short-lived request-reply helper. Each in-flight call owns its own blocking wait connection.
- If `add()` is deduplicated and returns `null`, `addAndWait()` rejects instead of hanging.
- `addAndWait()` does not support `removeOnComplete` or `removeOnFail`, because it may need the job hash as a terminal-state fallback.

### Batch Processing

Process multiple jobs at once for higher throughput on I/O-bound operations (bulk database inserts, batch API calls, ML inference).

```typescript
import { Worker, BatchError } from 'glide-mq';

const worker = new Worker(
  'bulk-insert',
  async (jobs) => {
    // jobs is Job[] - process all at once
    const results = await db.insertMany(jobs.map((j) => j.data));
    return results; // must return R[] with length === jobs.length
  },
  {
    connection,
    batch: {
      size: 50, // max jobs per batch
      timeout: 1000, // wait up to 1s for a full batch (optional)
    },
  },
);
```

Options:

- `batch.size` - maximum number of jobs to collect before invoking the processor (1-1000).
- `batch.timeout` - maximum time in ms to wait for additional jobs after a partial batch is received. When omitted, processes whatever is available immediately. The wait never claims past the worker's budget: a batch holds at most `min(batch.size, prefetch - jobs in flight)` jobs, so at most `concurrency * batch.size` jobs run at once, and a `prefetch` below `batch.size` caps every batch at `prefetch`.

**Partial failures** - throw `BatchError` to report per-job outcomes:

```typescript
const worker = new Worker(
  'mixed',
  async (jobs) => {
    const results = await Promise.allSettled(jobs.map(processOne));
    const mapped = results.map((r) => (r.status === 'fulfilled' ? r.value : r.reason));
    if (mapped.some((r) => r instanceof Error)) {
      throw new BatchError(mapped);
    }
    return mapped;
  },
  { connection, batch: { size: 10 } },
);
```

Each job is individually completed or failed based on its corresponding entry in the `BatchError.results` array. Failed jobs follow normal retry/backoff/DLQ rules.

### Pause and Resume a Job Later (Step Jobs)

Use `job.moveToDelayed(timestampMs, nextStep?)` inside a processor when the same logical job should sleep and resume later instead of completing.

```typescript
const worker = new Worker(
  'drip-campaign',
  async (job) => {
    switch (job.data.step) {
      case 'send':
        await sendEmail(job.data);
        return job.moveToDelayed(Date.now() + 24 * 3600_000, 'check');
      case 'check':
        if (!(await checkOpened(job.data))) {
          return job.moveToDelayed(Date.now() + 3600_000, 'followup');
        }
        return 'done';
      case 'followup':
        await sendFollowUp(job.data);
        return 'done';
    }
  },
  { connection },
);
```

Notes:

- `moveToDelayed()` must be called from an active worker processor.
- `nextStep` is a convenience for plain object payloads; it updates `job.data.step` atomically with the delayed transition.
- `DelayedError` is exported for advanced/manual control, but `job.moveToDelayed()` is the normal API.

### Dynamic Children (moveToWaitingChildren)

A parent processor can spawn child jobs at runtime, then call `job.moveToWaitingChildren()` to pause until all children complete. When the last child finishes, the parent resumes and the processor is invoked again.

```typescript
import { Queue, Worker, FlowProducer, WaitingChildrenError } from 'glide-mq';

const parentWorker = new Worker(
  'orchestrator',
  async (job) => {
    const step = job.data.step ?? 'spawn';

    if (step === 'spawn') {
      // Dynamically add child jobs
      const childQueue = new Queue('subtasks', { connection });
      await childQueue.add('chunk-1', { chunk: 1 }, { parent: { queue: 'orchestrator', id: job.id } });
      await childQueue.add('chunk-2', { chunk: 2 }, { parent: { queue: 'orchestrator', id: job.id } });
      await childQueue.close();

      // Advance the step first, or the re-run spawns the children again
      await job.updateData({ ...job.data, step: 'collect' });

      // Pause  -  throws WaitingChildrenError internally
      await job.moveToWaitingChildren();
    }

    // Resumed after all children completed
    const childResults = await job.getChildrenValues();
    return { merged: Object.values(childResults) };
  },
  { connection },
);
```

`moveToWaitingChildren()` throws `WaitingChildrenError` to signal the worker. The processor re-runs from the top when the children finish, with the data saved by `updateData()`. If all children have already completed by the time the call is made, the job goes straight back to waiting and runs again.

### UnrecoverableError

Throw `UnrecoverableError` in a processor to skip all remaining retries and move the job directly to the failed state. Useful for validation errors, bad input, or any condition where retrying is pointless.

```typescript
import { Worker, UnrecoverableError } from 'glide-mq';

const worker = new Worker(
  'tasks',
  async (job) => {
    if (!job.data.requiredField) {
      throw new UnrecoverableError('missing requiredField - will not retry');
    }

    // ... normal processing
  },
  { connection, concurrency: 5 },
);
```

The job is marked as permanently failed regardless of the `attempts` configuration. This is equivalent to calling `job.discard()` and then throwing, but more explicit.

## AI-native Primitives

glide-mq ships 7 AI-native primitives plus vector search. They work in both production (Valkey) and testing mode (in-memory).

### Job Metadata (reportUsage / getFlowUsage / getUsageSummary)

Track token usage, cost, and latency per job for cost attribution and observability.

```typescript
import { Worker, Queue } from 'glide-mq';

const worker = new Worker(
  'llm-tasks',
  async (job) => {
    const result = await callLLM(job.data.prompt);

    await job.reportUsage({
      model: 'gpt-5.4',
      provider: 'openai',
      tokens: { input: result.usage.prompt_tokens, output: result.usage.completion_tokens },
      costs: { total: result.usage.total_cost },
      latencyMs: result.latencyMs,
    });

    return result.text;
  },
  { connection },
);

// Aggregate usage for a job flow (parent + all children)
const usage = await queue.getFlowUsage(parentJobId);
console.log(usage.totalTokens, usage.totalCost);

// Aggregate rolling usage across queues for the last hour (default window)
const summary = await queue.getUsageSummary({ queues: ['llm-tasks', 'embeddings'] });
console.log(summary.totalTokens, summary.perQueue['llm-tasks']?.models);
```

`reportUsage()` persists usage to the job hash in Valkey. `job.usage` is populated when the job is fetched via `getJob()`. `getFlowUsage()` walks the job tree downward from the parent and sums all fields. `getUsageSummary()` reads rolling per-minute buckets, so it can summarize total tokens, cost, model counts, and per-queue breakdowns without scanning job hashes.

### Job Streaming Channel (stream / readStream)

Stream incremental output from a processor - useful for LLM token-by-token output or progress chunks.

```typescript
import { Worker, Queue } from 'glide-mq';

// Producer side: emit chunks from inside the processor
const worker = new Worker(
  'llm-stream',
  async (job) => {
    for await (const chunk of callLLMStreaming(job.data.prompt)) {
      await job.stream({ token: chunk.text });
    }
    return 'done';
  },
  { connection },
);

// Consumer side: read back all chunks after completion
const entries = await queue.readStream(jobId);
// entries: [{ id: '1-0', fields: { token: 'Hello' } }, ...]

// Resume from a known position
const more = await queue.readStream(jobId, { lastId: entries[entries.length - 1].id });
```

**Typed streaming convenience** - `job.streamChunk(type, content?)` wraps `stream()` with `{ type, content }` fields, matching the common pattern for LLM reasoning and content chunks:

```typescript
await job.streamChunk('reasoning', 'Let me think about this...');
await job.streamChunk('content', 'The answer is 42.');
await job.streamChunk('done');
```

**SSE endpoint** (proxy): `GET /queues/:name/jobs/:id/stream` streams chunks as Server-Sent Events while the job is active, then drains remaining chunks and closes. Supports the `Last-Event-ID` header and `?lastId` query param for resume.

Stream keys are automatically cleaned up when a job is removed via `job.remove()`, `queue.clean()`, or `queue.drain()`.

**Testing mode**: `TestJob.stream()` and `TestQueue.readStream()` provide full parity with no Valkey dependency.

### Suspend/Resume with Signals

Suspend a job mid-processor and resume it later via an external signal. Designed for human-in-the-loop workflows: approval gates, webhook callbacks, or any pattern where a job must pause and wait for external input.

```typescript
import { Worker, Queue, SuspendError } from 'glide-mq';

const worker = new Worker(
  'approvals',
  async (job) => {
    if (job.data.step === 'process') {
      // Start work...
      const draft = await generateDraft(job.data);

      // Suspend and wait for human approval
      await job.suspend({
        reason: 'awaiting-approval',
        timeout: 86_400_000, // fail after 24 h if no signal arrives
        onResume: async (signals) => {
          // Called on the same worker instance when the job is re-queued (best-effort)
          const approval = signals[0];
          if (approval.name === 'approve') {
            return await publishDraft(draft, approval.data);
          }
          throw new Error('Draft rejected');
        },
      });
    }
    // Fallback path if onResume is not used (job re-enters processor normally)
    return await publishDraft(job.data);
  },
  { connection },
);

// From outside (e.g., a webhook handler) - send the signal:
const resumed = await queue.signal(jobId, 'approve', { reviewer: 'alice' });
// resumed: true if the job was in suspended state and has been re-queued
```

#### How it works

1. `job.suspend(opts?)` stores a suspend request and throws `SuspendError`. The worker catches it, calls `glidemq_suspend` (FCALL), and moves the job to the `suspended` sorted set.
2. `queue.signal(jobId, name, data?)` calls `glidemq_signal` (FCALL). The signal is appended to the job and the job is re-queued into the stream with state `waiting`.
3. When the job is re-dispatched, the worker checks for a registered `onResume` continuation. If present (same worker instance), it is called with `signals[]` instead of the main processor. Otherwise, the main processor runs and reads `job.signals`.
4. If `timeout` is set, glide-mq stores the deadline in the `suspended` sorted set and a lightweight background sweep in any live `Queue` or `Worker` runtime fails expired suspended jobs with reason `'Suspend timeout exceeded'`. This no longer depends on a worker staying online, but it does require at least one glide-mq process to remain connected to the queue.

#### Options

```typescript
interface SuspendOptions {
  reason?: string; // Human-readable label stored on the job hash
  timeout?: number; // Milliseconds until auto-fail (0 = infinite, default)
}
```

The `onResume` callback on `job.suspend()` is separate from `SuspendOptions` - it is a best-effort in-process continuation, not persisted to Valkey.

#### Reading suspension state

```typescript
const info = await queue.getSuspendInfo(jobId);
// null if not suspended
// { reason, suspendedAt, timeout?, signals: SignalEntry[] }
```

#### Proxy endpoints

The proxy exposes REST endpoints for suspend/resume inspection and control:

```
GET  /queues/:name/suspended
GET  /queues/:name/jobs/:id/suspend
POST /queues/:name/jobs/:id/signal
POST /queues/:name/jobs/:id/revoke
{ "name": "approve", "data": { "reviewer": "alice" } }
```

- `GET /queues/:name/suspended` lists suspended jobs with their suspend metadata.
- `GET /queues/:name/jobs/:id/suspend` returns `{ reason, suspendedAt, timeout?, signals }` for one suspended job.
- `POST /queues/:name/jobs/:id/signal` returns `{ "resumed": true|false }`.
- `POST /queues/:name/jobs/:id/revoke` returns `{ "status": "revoked" | "flagged" }`.

#### Testing mode

`TestJob.suspend()` and `TestQueue.signal()` provide full parity with no Valkey dependency:

```typescript
import { TestQueue, TestWorker } from 'glide-mq/testing';

const queue = new TestQueue('approvals');
const worker = new TestWorker(queue, async (job) => {
  await job.suspend({ reason: 'needs-review' });
});

// Signal from outside
const resumed = await queue.signal(jobId, 'approve');
```

### Fallback Chains

Ordered list of model/provider alternatives tried on retryable failure. The worker auto-advances through the chain on each retry.

Set fallbacks in JobOptions when adding a job. Inside the processor, read job.currentFallback to determine which model to use. job.fallbackIndex starts at 0 (original request). On each retry failure, glidemq_fail increments the index by 1. Each fallback entry can carry arbitrary metadata for provider-specific configuration.

See [ADVANCED.md](./advanced#fallback-chains) for details on how the chain advances.

### Budget Middleware (Flow-level Token/Cost Caps)

Enforce hard caps on total tokens and/or cost across all jobs in a flow. Pass a budget option to FlowProducer.add() with maxTotalTokens, maxTotalCost, and onExceeded (fail or pause). Per-category limits are also supported via maxTokens (e.g. `{ input: 5000 }`), tokenWeights (e.g. `{ output: 4 }`), maxCosts, and costUnit. When an attempt of a job in a budgeted flow ends, whether it completes or fails, the worker charges the usage it reported with reportUsage() through glidemq_recordUsageAndCheckBudget, which atomically increments counters and checks limits. A retry that reports no new usage is not charged again. Batch workers charge and check budgets the same way, per job.

Query budget state via queue.getFlowBudget(flowId). Change the limits of a running flow with queue.updateFlowBudget(flowId, limits): only the given fields change, null deletes a limit, and the exceeded flag is re-evaluated against the usage already charged. With onExceeded 'pause', paused jobs re-check the budget every 60 seconds (Worker.BUDGET_PAUSE_RECHECK_MS), so raising the limits resumes the flow within that interval; job.promote() re-checks at once. Budget state is stored in glide:{queueName}:budget:{flowId}.

```typescript
const flow = new FlowProducer({ connection });
const node = await flow.add(
  { name: 'parent', queueName: 'ai-tasks', data: {}, children: [...] },
  { budget: { maxTotalTokens: 10000, maxTotalCost: 0.50, costUnit: 'usd', onExceeded: 'fail' } },
);

// Check budget state
const budget = await queue.getFlowBudget(node.job.id);
// { maxTotalTokens: 10000, maxTotalCost: 0.50, usedTokens: 0, usedCost: 0, exceeded: false, ... }

// Raise the cost cap of a running flow; clears exceeded when usage fits the new limits
await queue.updateFlowBudget(node.job.id, { maxTotalCost: 1.0 });
```

### Dual-axis Rate Limiting (RPM + TPM)

The tokenLimiter on WorkerOptions adds token-per-minute (TPM) rate limiting alongside the existing RPM limiter. Both limits compose - the worker pauses fetching when either is exceeded.

Jobs report token consumption via job.reportTokens(count) or automatically via job.reportUsage() (which extracts totalTokens). Supports three scopes: queue (shared Valkey counter), worker (in-memory), or both (default - local check first, then Valkey).

### Per-job Lock Duration

Override the worker-level lockDuration for individual jobs via opts.lockDuration. Useful for mixed workloads where some jobs are fast and others are long-running. The per-job lockDuration is read by glidemq_reclaimStalled and glidemq_reclaimStalledListJobs to set the stall threshold per job.

The stall threshold resolution chain is: per-job `opts.lockDuration` (if set) > worker-level `lockDuration` > `stalledInterval`. The scheduler also checks only every `stalledInterval`, and stream entries are claimed only after they have been idle for `stalledInterval`. So a stalled job is recovered no sooner than `max(stalledInterval, threshold)` after its last heartbeat. To get fast stall recovery, lower both `stalledInterval` and `lockDuration`.

### Vector Search (createJobIndex / storeVector / vectorSearch)

Create a Valkey Search index over job hashes, store vector embeddings, and run KNN similarity search. Requires the Valkey Search module.

Use queue.createJobIndex() to create an index with optional vector fields. Inside the processor, call job.storeVector(field, embedding) to store Float32 vectors. Query with queue.vectorSearch(embedding, opts) for KNN results.

The index is built over job hashes using FT.CREATE. Base fields (name, state, timestamp, priority) are always included. Testing mode provides in-memory parity via TestJob.storeVector(), TestQueue.createJobIndex(), and TestQueue.vectorSearch().

`vectorSearch` passes `opts.searchOptions` through to FT.SEARCH: `nocontent`, `dialect`, `verbatim`, `inorder`, `slop` and `sortby`. The `scorer` option was removed in 0.16: no released Valkey Search accepts SCORER and the client never sent it, so it had no effect. Unknown keys are still ignored at runtime.

See [ADVANCED.md](./advanced#vector-search-index-management) for index management details.

### Proxy Endpoints

The proxy (`glide-mq/proxy`) exposes queue, scheduler, flow, and broadcast endpoints over HTTP:

```typescript
import { createProxyServer } from 'glide-mq/proxy';

const proxy = createProxyServer({
  connection,
  queues: ['tasks', 'broadcast-events'], // optional allowlist
});

proxy.app.listen(3000);
```

- Add your own auth/rate-limit middleware before exposing the proxy to a network. The proxy does not ship built-in authentication.
- Queue-wide SSE (`/queues/:name/events`) and broadcast SSE (`/broadcast/:name/events`) require `connection`, not just a shared `client`, because they allocate blocking readers internally.
- 5xx responses return a generic message (`Internal server error`, `Service unavailable`, `Gateway timeout`) except for proxy-authored ones such as `Proxy is shutting down`. The underlying error goes to `onError`.
- List and batch routes are bounded by `maxPageSize` (default `1000`). `GET /queues/:name/jobs`, `/dlq`, and `/suspended` return at most `maxPageSize` items from `start` when `end` is omitted or `-1`, and reject an explicit `start`/`end` span larger than the cap with `400`. `POST /queues/:name/dlq/replay-all` and `POST /queues/:name/retry` default `count` to the cap and `DELETE /queues/:name/clean` defaults `limit` to the cap; larger values (or `count=0`) return `400`. Page through larger sets with `start`/`end`, and repeat retry until `retried` is `0`.
- `GET /queues/:name/metrics` returns the whole per-minute metrics hash and is not paged; `start`/`end` slice the returned data points only.
- `POST /queues/:name/jobs/wait` holds one dedicated blocking connection per in-flight request. `opts.waitTimeout` above `maxWaitTimeout` (default `60000` ms) returns `400`; an omitted `waitTimeout` uses `30000` ms capped at `maxWaitTimeout`. If the HTTP client disconnects before the result, the proxy stops waiting and releases the connection; the job itself stays queued.

- `POST /flows` supports both FlowProducer-style trees and DAG payloads. Queue names inside the submitted flow must pass the proxy allowlist. A flow may hold at most 1000 nodes (tree nodes counted across all levels, or `dag.nodes` entries); larger flows return `400`.
- Flow budgets are persisted and returned through `/flows/:id` and `/queues/:name/flows/:id/budget`, but HTTP-submitted budgets are currently supported only for tree flows, not DAG payloads.
